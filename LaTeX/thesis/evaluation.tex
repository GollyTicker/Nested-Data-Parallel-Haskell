This chapter will summarise results of the the four implementations
\seq, \man, \ndpn and \npdv.

\section{Complexities}
  * show a table of complexities.

\section{Constant Factors}
  * summarise the constant factors each implemenation has

\section{Ranking}

  Different ratios of gmax and n make differnt algorithms faster. (binary tree of desicions)
  
  % Use bullet points from analysis .tex!
  
  Before moving to the next chapter - one shall be reminded that
  \man involved much manual work. It was not a direct translation
  of the algorithms description. It, especially requires
  the subsequent algorithms to use a flat image representation.
  \footnote{Unless one wraps \man with (un-)flattening operations.
  However, that approach is a manual replication of the
  flattening approach used in NDP.}
