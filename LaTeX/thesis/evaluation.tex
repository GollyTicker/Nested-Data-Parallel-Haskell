  Before moving to the next chapter - one shall be reminded that
  \man involved much manual work. It was not a direct translation
  of the algorithms description. It, especially requires
  the subsequent algorithms to use a flat image representation.
  \footnote{Unless one wraps \man with (un-)flattening operations.
  However, that approach is a manual replication of the
  flattening approach used in NDP.}
