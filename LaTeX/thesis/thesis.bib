    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe a sorting network of size 0(n log n) and depth 0(log {n).A} natural way of sorting is through consecutive halvings: determine the upper and lower halves of the set, proceed similarly within the halves, and so on. Unfortunately, while one can halve a set using only 0(n) comparisons, this cannot be done in less than log n (parallel) time, and it is known that a halving network needs (Â½)n log n {comparisons.It} is possible, however, to construct a network of 0(n) comparisons which halves in constant time with high accuracy. This procedure (\&egr;-halving) and a derived procedure (\&egr;-nearsort) are described below, and our sorting network will be centered around these elementary steps.},

@article{GenVectorFusion2013,
    abstract = {Stream fusion is a powerful technique for automatically transforming high-level sequence-processing functions into efficient implementations. It has been used to great effect in Haskell libraries for manipulating byte arrays, Unicode text, and unboxed vectors. However, some operations, like vector append, still do not perform well within the standard stream fusion framework. Others, like {SIMD} computation using the {SSE} and {AVX} instructions available on modern x86 chips, do not seem to fit in the framework at all.  In this paper we introduce generalized stream fusion, which solves these issues. The key insight is to bundle together multiple stream representations, each tuned for a particular class of stream consumer. We also describe a stream representation suited for efficient computation with {SSE} instructions. Our ideas are implemented in modified versions of the {GHC} compiler and vector library. Benchmarks show that high-level Haskell code written using our compiler and libraries can produce code that is faster than both compiler- and hand-vectorized C.},

It turns out that this idea directly supports a powerful form of abstraction called associated types, which are available in C++ using traits classes. Associated types are useful in many applications, especially for self-optimising libraries that adapt their data representations and algorithms in a type-directed {manner.In} this paper, we introduce and motivate associated types as a rather natural generalisation of Haskell's existing type classes. Formally, we present a type system that includes a type-directed translation into an explicitly typed target language akin to System F; the existence of this translation ensures that the addition of associated data types to an existing Haskell compiler only requires changes to the front end.},

@article{CostArray2002Leshchinskiy,
    abstract = {We discuss a language-based cost model for array programs built on the notions of work complexity and parallel depth. The programs operate over data structures comprising nested arrays and recursive product-sum types. In a purely functional setting, such programs can be implemented by way of the flattening transformation that converts codes over nested arrays into vectorised code over flat arrays. Flat arrays lend themselves to a particularly efficient implementation on standard hardware, but the overall efficiency of the approach depends on the flattening transformation preserving the asymptotic complexity of the nested array codes. Blelloch has characterised a class of first-order array programs, called contained programs, for which flattening preserves the asymptotic depth complexity. However, his result is restricted to programs processing only arrays and tuples. In the present paper, we extend Blelloch's result to array programs processing data structures containing arrays as well as arbitrary recursive product-sum types. Moreover, we replace the notion of containment by the more general concept of fold programs.},

    abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to optimizing array algorithms in functional languages. We are specifically aiming at an efficient implementation of irregular array algorithms that are hard to implement in conventional array languages such as Fortran. We optimize the storage layout of arrays containing complex data structures and reduce the running time of functions operating on these arrays by means of equational program transformations. In particular, this paper discusses a novel form of combinator loop fusion, which by removing intermediate structures optimizes the use of the memory hierarchy. We identify a combinator named loop P that provides a general scheme for iterating over an array and that in conjunction with an array constructor replicate P is sufficient to express a wide range of array algorithms. On this basis, we define equational transformation rules that combine traversals of loop P and replicate P as well as sequences of applications of loop P into a single loop P traversal. Our approach naturally generalizes to a parallel implementation and includes facilities for optimizing load balancing and communication. A prototype implementation based on the rewrite rule pragma of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler is significantly faster than standard Haskell arrays and approaches the speed of hand coded C for simple examples.},

@phdthesis{DataAlgo12014Prokopec,
    abstract = {The data-parallel programming model fits nicely with the existing declarative-style bulk operations that augment collection libraries in many languages today. Data collection operations like reduction, filtering or mapping can be executed by a single processor or many processors at once. However, there are multiple challenges to overcome when parallelizing collection operations.

First, it is challenging to construct a collection in parallel by multiple processors. Traditionally, collections are backed by data structures with thread-safe variants of their update operations. Such data structures are called concurrent data structures. Their update operations require interprocessor synchronization and are generally slower than the corresponding single-threaded update operations. Synchronization costs can easily invalidate performance gains from parallelizing bulk operations such as mapping or filtering. This thesis presents a parallel collection framework with a range of data structures that reduce the need for interprocessor synchronization, effectively boosting data-parallel operation performance. The parallel collection framework is implemented in Scala, but the techniques in this thesis can be applied to other managed runtimes.

Second, most concurrent data structures can only be traversed in the absence of concurrent modifications. We say that such concurrent data structures are quiescently consistent. The task of ensuring quiescence falls on the programmer. This thesis presents a novel, lock-free, scalable concurrent data structure called a Ctrie, which supports a linearizable, lock-free, constant-time snapshot operation. The Ctrie snapshot operation is used to parallelize Ctrie operations without the need for quiescence. We show how the linearizable, lock-free, constant-time snapshot operation can be applied to different concurrent, lock-free tree-like data structures.

Finally, efficiently assigning parts of the computation to different processors, or scheduling, is not trivial. Although most computer systems have several identical {CPUs}, memory hiearchies, cache-coherence protocols and interference with concurrent processes influence the effective speed of a {CPU}. Moreover, some data-parallel operations inherently require more work for some elements of the collection than others â we say that no data-parallel operation has a uniform workload in practice. This thesis presents a novel technique for parallelizing highly irregular computation workloads, called the work-stealing tree scheduling. We show that the work-stealing tree scheduler outperforms other schedulers when parallelizing highly irregular workloads, and retains optimal performance when parallelizing more uniform workloads.

Concurrent algorithms and data structure operations in this thesis are linearizable and lock-free. We present pseudocode with detailed correctness proofs for concurrent data structures and algorithms in this thesis, validating their correctness, identifying linearization points and showing their lock-freedom.},

    abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the implementation of {NESL}, a portable nested data-parallel language. This language and its implementation are the first to fully support nested data structures as well as nested data-parallel function calls. These features allow the concise description of parallel algorithms on irregular data, such as sparse matrices and graphs. In addition, they maintain the advantages of data-parallel languages: a simple programming model and portability. The current {NESL} implementation is based on an intermediate language called {VCODE} and a library of vector routines called {CVL}. It runs on the Connection Machine {CM}-2, the Cray {Y-MP} C90, and serial machines. We compare initial benchmark results of {NESL} with those of machine-specific code on these machines for three algorithms: least-squares line-fitting, median finding, and a sparse-matrix vector product. These results show that {NESL}'s performance is competitive with that of machine-specific codes for regular dense data, and is often superior for irregular data.},

    abstract = {A critical component of many data-parallel programming languages are operations that manipulate aggregate data structures as a wholeâthis includes Fortran 90, Nesl, and languages based on {BMF}. These operations are commonly implemented by a library whose routines operate on a distributed representation of the aggregate structure; the compiler merely generates the control code invoking the library routines and all machine-dependent code is encapsulated in the library. While this approach is convenient, we argue that by breaking the abstraction enforced by the library and by presenting some of internals in the form of a new intermediate language to the compiler back-end, we can optimize on al levels of the memory hierarchy and achieve more flexible data distribution. The new intermediate language allows us to present these optimisations elegantly as program transformations. We report on first results obtained by our approach in the implementation of nested data parallelism on distributed-memory machines.},

Nested data parallelism is significantly more expressive and convenient to use than the flat data parallelism typically used in conventional parallel languages like High Performance Fortran and C*. The flattening transformation of Blelloch and Sabot is a key technique for the efficient implementation of nested parallelism via flat parallelism, but originally it was severely restricted, as it did not permit general sum types, recursive types, higher-order functions, and separate compilation. Subsequent work, including some of our own, generalised the transformation and allowed higher-order functions and recursive types. In this paper, we take the final step of generalising flattening to cover the full range of types available in modern languages like Haskell and {ML}; furthermore, we enable the use of separate compilation. In addition, we present a completely new formulation of the transformation, which is based on the standard lambda calculus notation, and replace a previously ad-hoc transformation step by a systematic generic programming technique. First experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.},

In particular, stream fusion is able to fuse zips, left folds and functions over nested lists, including list comprehensions. A distinguishing feature of the framework is its simplicity: by transforming list functions to expose their structure, intermediate values are eliminated by general purpose compiler optimisations. We have reimplemented the Haskell standard List library on top of our framework, providing stream fusion for Haskell lists. By allowing a wider range of functions to fuse, we see an increase in the number of occurrences of fusion in typical Haskell programs. We present benchmarks documenting time and space improvements.},

However, the naive compilation of such programs quickly leads to both code explosion and an excessive use of intermediate data structures. The resulting slow-down is not acceptable on target hardware that is usually chosen to achieve high performance. In this paper, we discuss two optimisation techniques, sharing recovery and array fusion, that tackle code explosion and eliminate superfluous intermediate structures. Both techniques are well known from other contexts, but they present unique challenges for an embedded language compiled for execution on a {GPU}. We present novel methods for implementing sharing recovery and array fusion, and demonstrate their effectiveness on a set of benchmarks.},

Most of the programs ported to {GPUs} thus far use traditional data-level parallelism, performing only operations that operate uniformly over vectors. {NESL} is a first-order functional language that was designed to allow programmers to write irregular-parallel programs - such as parallel divide-and-conquer algorithms - for wide-vector parallel computers. This paper presents our port of the {NESL} implementation to work on {GPUs} and provides empirical evidence that nested data-parallelism ({NDP}) on {GPUs} significantly outperforms {CPU}-based implementations and matches or beats newer {GPU} languages that support only flat parallelism. While our performance does not match that of hand-tuned {CUDA} programs, we argue that the notational conciseness of {NESL} is worth the loss in performance. This work provides the first language implementation that directly supports {NDP} on a {GPU}.},

The main highlights of our approach are that it (1) is purely functional, (2) supports reuse through shape polymorphism, (3) avoids unnecessary intermediate structures rather than relying on subsequent loop fusion, and (4) supports transparent parallelisation. We show how to embed two forms of shape polymorphism into Haskell's type system using type classes and type families. In particular, we discuss the generalisation of regular array transformations to arrays of higher rank, and introduce a type-safe specification of array slices. We discuss the runtime performance of our approach for three standard array algorithms. We achieve absolute performance comparable to handwritten C code.

@inproceedings{Svensson2012Parallel,
    abstract = {Nowadays, performance in processors is increased by adding more cores or wider vector units, or by combining accelerators like {GPUs} and traditional cores on a chip. Programming for these diverse architectures is a challenge. We would like to exploit all the resources at hand without putting too much burden on the programmer. Ideally, the programmer should be presented with a machine model abstracted from the specific number of cores, {SIMD} width or the existence of a {GPU} or not. Intel's Array Building Blocks ({ArBB}) is a system that takes on these challenges. {ArBB} is a language for data parallel and nested data parallel programming, embedded in C++. By offering a retargetable dynamic compilation framework, it provides vectorisation and threading to programmers without the need to write highly architecture specific code. We aim to bring the same benefits to the Haskell programmer by implementing a Haskell frontend (embedding) of the {ArBB} system. We call this embedding {EmbArBB}. We use standard Haskell embedded language procedures to provide an interface to the {ArBB} functionality in Haskell. {EmbArBB} is work in progress and does not currently support all of the {ArBB} functionality. Some small programming examples illustrate how the Haskell embedding is used to write programs. {ArBB} code is short and to the point in both C++ and Haskell. Matrix multiplication has been benchmarked in sequential C++, {ArBB} in C++, {EmbArBB} and the Repa library. The C++ and the Haskell embeddings have almost identical performance, showing that the Haskell embedding does not impose any large extra overheads. Two image processing algorithms have also been benchmarked against Repa. In these benchmarks at least, {EmbArBB} performance is much better than that of the Repa library, indicating that building on {ArBB} may be a cheap and easy approach to exploiting data parallelism in Haskell.},

    abstract = {There are many approaches to exploiting multi-cores, but a particularly promising one is the "data-parallel" paradigm, because it combines massive parallelism (on both shared and distributed memory) with a simple, single-control-flow programming model. Indeed, I think that data parallelism is the only way we will be able to exploit tens or hundreds of processors effectively.

Alas, data-parallel programming is usually restricted to "flat" data parallelism, which is good for implementers but bad for programmers. Instead, I'll describe the "nested" data parallel programming model, first developed in the 90's by Blelloch and Sabot. It is great for programmers but much harder to implement; as a result, it's virtually unknown in practice. It's really only feasible to support nested data parallelism in a purely functional language, so we are building a high-performance implementation in Haskell.},

@inproceedings{Harness2008,
    abstract = {If you want to program a parallel computer, a purely functional language like Haskell is a promising starting point. Since the language is pure, it is by-default safe for parallel evaluation, whereas imperative languages are by-default unsafe. But that doesn't make it easy! Indeed it has proved quite difficult to get robust, scalable performance increases through parallel functional programming, especially as the number of processors increases. A particularly promising and well-studied approach to employing large numbers of processors is to use data parallelism. Blelloch's pioneering work on {NESL} showed that it was possible to combine a rather flexible programming model (nested data parallelism) with a fast, scalable execution model (flat data parallelism). In this talk I will describe Data Parallel Haskell, which embodies nested data parallelism in a modern, general-purpose language, implemented in a state-of-the-art compiler, {GHC}. I will focus particularly on the vectorisation transformation, which transforms nested to flat data parallelism, and I hope to present performance numbers.},

@article{Trinder1998Algorithm,
    abstract = {The process of writing large parallel programs is complicated by the need to specify both the parallel behaviour of the program and the algorithm that is to be used to compute its result. This paper introduces evaluation strategies: lazy higher-order functions that control the parallel evaluation of non-strict functional languages. Using evaluation strategies, it is possible to achieve a clean separation between algorithmic and behavioural code. The result is enhanced clarity and shorter parallel programs. Evaluation strategies are a very general concept: this paper shows how they can be used to model a wide range of commonly used programming paradigms, including divide-and-conquer parallelism, pipeline parallelism, producer/consumer parallelism, and data-oriented parallelism. Because they are based on unrestricted higher-order functions, they can also capture irregular parallel structures. Evaluation strategies are not just of theoretical interest: they have evolved out of our experience in parallelising several large-scale parallel applications, where they have proved invaluable in helping to manage the complexities of parallel behaviour. Some of these applications are described in detail here. The largest application we have studied to date, Lolita, is a 40,000 line natural language engineering system. Initial results show that for these programs we can achieve acceptable parallel performance, for relatively little programming effort.},

@electronic{Wadler2000Proofs,
    abstract = {As the 19th century drew to a close, logicians formalized an ideal notion of proof. They were driven
by nothing other than an abiding interest in truth, and their proofs were as ethereal as the mind of God.
Yet within decades these mathematical abstractions were realized by the hand of man, in the digital
stored-program computer. How it came to be recognized that proofs and programs are the same thing is
a story that spans a century, a chase with as many twists and turns as a thriller. At the end of the story
is a new principle for designing programming languages that will guide computers into the 21st century.
For my money, Gentzen's natural deduction and Church's lambda calculus are on a par with Einstein's
relativity and Dirac's quantum physics for elegance and insight. And the maths are a lot simpler. I want
to show you the essence of these ideas. I'll need a few symbols, but not too many, and I'll explain as I go
along.
To simplify, I'll present the story as we understand it now, with some asides to fill in the history.
First, I'll introduce Gentzen's natural deduction, a formalism for proofs. Next, I'll introduce Church's
lambda calculus, a formalism for programs. Then I'll explain why proofs and programs are really the
same thing, and how simplifying a proof corresponds to executing a program. Finally, I'll conclude with
a look at how these principles are being applied to design a new generation of programming languages,
particularly mobile code for the Internet.},

Of particular interest is how specific social media tools are being used to enhance networking opportunities and contribute to career progression. The use of social media was explored in detail through interviews and a survey. Typical activities that are currently being undertaken were identified and user group profiles developed that articulate different levels of engagement with these tools and the motivations that each group of users have for using social media. The study found that, with increasing levels of activity, the number of motivations for using social media increase, as does the perceived number of successful outcomes, including contributions towards career progression. The main barriers to using social media were identified as a lack of time and skills to undertake these activities, as well as a negative perception of social media. Recommendations for increasing participation are to provide practical training, including the sharing of good practice, and to initiate dialogues within institutions regarding the potential career progression opportunities that social media may afford.},

    abstract = {This thesis introduces the language {QML}, a functional language for quantum computations on finite types. {QML} exhibits quantum data and control structures, and integrates reversible and irreversible quantum computations.

The design of {QML} is guided by the categorical semantics: {QML} programs are interpreted by morphisms in the category {FQC} of finite quantum computations, which provides a constructive operational semantics of irreversible quantum computations, realisable as quantum circuits. The quantum circuit model is also given a formal categorical definition via the category {FQC}.

{QML} integrates reversible and irreversible quantum computations in one language, using first order strict linear logic to make weakenings, which may lead to the collapse of the quantum wavefunction, explicit. Strict programs are free from measurement, and hence preserve superpositions and entanglement.

A denotational semantics of {QML} programs is presented, which maps {QML} terms into superoperators, via the operational semantics, made precise by the category Q. Extensional equality for {QML} programs is also presented, via a mapping from {FQC} morphisms into the category Q.},

@article{Bettelli2003Toward,
    abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that, if a useful device for quantum
computation will ever be built, it will be embodied by a classical computing
machine with control over a truly quantum subsystem, this apparatus performing
a mixture of classical and quantum computation.


This paper investigates a possible approach to the problem of programming
such machines: a template high level quantum language is presented which
complements a generic general purpose classical language with a set of quantum
primitives. The underlying scheme involves a run-time environment which
calculates the byte-code for the quantum operations and pipes it to a quantum
device controller or to a simulator.


This language can compactly express existing quantum algorithms and reduce
them to sequences of elementary operations; it also easily lends itself to
automatic, hardware independent, circuit simplification. A publicly available
preliminary implementation of the proposed ideas has been realized using the
C++ language.},
