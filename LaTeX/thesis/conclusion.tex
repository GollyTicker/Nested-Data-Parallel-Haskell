    "Alternate Algorithms"
      Rose Tree Data strcture -> Interesting, Custom Types, too compliated
      Djikstra on Image -> Too regular, huge for manual vectorization
        Connected Components Labeling -> huge for manual vectorization
        Contour Detection -> Too fast and simple to benefit from parallization
