  further analysis with more knowledge about implementations
  would enable the use exact counts of operations ratther than only Big O classes.
  
  One could use Breent's Equation and solve for
  solutions in the parameter space where the on or the other
  implementation is better.
  
  "Alternate Algorithms"
    Rose Tree Data strcture -> Interesting, Custom Types, too compliated
    Djikstra on Image -> Too regular, huge for manual vectorization
      Connected Components Labeling -> huge for manual vectorization
      Contour Detection -> Too fast and simple to benefit from parallization
