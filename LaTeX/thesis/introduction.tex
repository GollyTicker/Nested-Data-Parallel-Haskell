    Context like in the expose.
    Why Image Processing? Simply interesting topic. Using Histogram Balancing
    Why Haskell?
      Focus on practical functional programming
      many researchers do their work in the haskell community,
        on of them will be used here - that is Nested Data Parallel Haskell
      I enjoyed haskell the most and learned many concepts there. (like in expose)
  \section{Goal}
    Leading question. Subquestion.
    Formulating the approach
