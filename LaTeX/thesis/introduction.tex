\section{Context}
  TODO
  
  !Context like in the expose!
  
  Why Image Processing? Simply interesting topic. Using Histogram Balancing
  
  
  Focus on practical functional programming.
    Why Haskell?
    many researchers do their work in the haskell community,
      on of them will be used here - that is Nested Data Parallel Haskell
    I enjoyed haskell the most and learned many concepts there. (like in expose)
    
    Results can (and are) applied to other functional programming
    lanuguages. cite? 
    
    
    Constant Factors

\section{Goal}
  Leading question. Subquestion.
  Formulating the approach
  
  Formulate Concept/Algorithm of Histogram Balanding as $A$.

\section{Structure}
  Describe what each chapter does
