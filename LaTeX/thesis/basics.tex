\section{Nested Data Parallelism}
  Contrast Nested vs Flat data parallelism,
  Nested Data Parallelism in Haskell, an ongoing project.
  This work uses many ideas from their work.
  Show functions used to program in NDPH.
  Show vectorized types and data for AInt, ATup2, AArr and AClo/Clo.
  Transformation and explain main types (#25 in Notizblock).
  "Explicit calls to AArr and ATup2 and such mean global communication"
  "Types of PAs are global. Types of Dist are local."

  Each occurrence of \c{mapP f} is replaced by \c{fL} where \c{fL} is the lifted version
  of that function. For user defined-functions, this lifted function
  is automatically defined using other parallel primitives. However, for
  some special functions, there exists a special lifted implementation.
  We are concerned about nested parallel constructs like \c{mapP (mapP f)}.
  They are transformed into the following construct
  \begin{lstlisting}
  mapP (mapP f) xss = unconcatPS xss
                      . fL (expandPS xss fEnv)
                      . concatPS
                      $ xss
  \end{lstlisting}
  This is the key insight in nested data parallelism! Nested parallel operations
  can be reduced to flattening the array (line 3), applying a flat data-parallel operation (line 2)
  and finally unflattening the new array into the original structure (line 1).
  
  Show that GHC supports Inlining and Fusion through Rewrite Rules.
\section{Parallel Computing and Complexity Measures}
  Explain Work and Depth Complexity measures
   (and their definitions?)

\section{\algo}
  Introductipn into Histogram Balancing.
  
  Prefix sum is a very common operation in computer science. It is a special
    case of scanning through a ordered container from left ro right applying a binary
    associative function \c{f}.
    It is defined as:
      $$ scanl(f,z,[a_1,a_2,...,a_n])
         := [f(z,a_1),f(f(z,a_1),a_2),...,f(f(...f(f(z,a_1),a_2)...,a_{n-1}),a_n)]
      $$
    An example shall be $scanl(+,0,[1,2,2,3,-2]) = [1,3,5,8,6]$. In some definitions
    the first element is $z$. This is however not the definition we need here.
    
  
  Uses thereof and overview of an algorithm.
