  The sequenial algorithm is a straightforward implementation of the previosly
  described algorithm for \algo.
  
  \section{Implementation}
    Show code,
    Reexplain syntax,
    Explain how it works in words (uses binary-tree maps, dense-arrays,etc..)
    
  \section{Runtime analysis}
    Do runtime analysis like in analysis/seq.tex. But a bit less detailed.
    (The actual derivations could be packed into an appendix!)
