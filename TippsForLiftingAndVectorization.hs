Naming conventions.

mapP
  is the parallel array variant of map.
  it operates on user-arrays [: a :]

lengthPA
  is the parallel array variant of lengthP which
  operates on the type-dependent representation

mapPV is the vectorized mapP function

mapPS is the concrete scalar version in mapPV
mapPL is the concrete lifted version in mapPV

Let expresion vectorization:
V[ let a = b in c ] = (\a -> V[c]) V[b]
  Proof see #11

Let expression lifting:
L[ let a = b in c ] n
L[ (\a -> c) b ] n
  = L[\a -> c] $:L L[b]
  = AClo {
       aenv = ATupk n y1..yk
      ,ascalar = \(y1..yk) a -> V[c]
      ,alifted = \(ATupk n y1..yk) a -> L[c] n
    } $:L L[b] n
  = (\a -> (L[c] n)) (L[b] n)

V[ f ] = V[ \a -> b ] where f is declared top-level
V[ f ] =
  Clo {
     env = ()
    ,scalar = \() a -> V[b]
    ,lifted = \(ATup0 n) a -> L[b] n
  }

Tuple Lifting: (,)L -> ATup2

Innerhalb eines mapP wird die scalare Variante nicht mehr benÃ¶tigt.
mapP f xs wird immer fL verwenden (siehe Core of flattening).

both varients to account for repliations, mapping and indexing in context.
